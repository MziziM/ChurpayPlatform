# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, following a component-based architecture. It uses Radix UI with shadcn/ui for components, Tailwind CSS for styling with custom brand variables and gradients. State management is handled by React Query, routing by Wouter, and form validation by React Hook Form with Zod schemas. Data visualization is powered by Recharts. The application implements role-based routing for distinct user experiences (super admin, church admin, church staff, members, public users).

## Backend Architecture
The server is built with Express.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and ESM modules, following a RESTful API design pattern. It uses Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and integrates with Replit Auth for session-based authentication. The file structure is modular, separating routes, storage, and database configurations.

## Data Storage Solutions
PostgreSQL is the primary database, hosted on Neon Database. It features a comprehensive relational schema with foreign key relationships and PostgreSQL enums for status fields. Drizzle Kit is used for database migrations, and Neon serverless connection pooling ensures optimal performance. Key tables include users, churches, projects, transactions, payouts, and activity logs.

## Authentication and Authorization
The system uses Replit Auth for user authentication with a five-tier role-based access control system (superadmin, church_admin, church_staff, member, public). Session management is PostgreSQL-backed, and users are linked to specific churches for scoped access. Security measures include secure session handling with HTTP-only cookies and CSRF protection.

## UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a professional, enterprise-grade dark theme financial dashboard. It incorporates modern fintech styling, comprehensive sidebar navigation, and enterprise-grade headers. Visual elements include gradient finance cards, interactive charts, and dynamic displays for projects and giving history. Design patterns emphasize a unified, professional appearance across all dashboards, utilizing consistent ChurPay branding with purple/yellow gradients and professional visual hierarchy inspired by fintech industry standards. Components like backdrop-blur glass effects and professional quick action cards contribute to a premium user experience.
